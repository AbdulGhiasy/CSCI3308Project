# CSCI3308Project

Team Name: Team 7

Members: Phi Trang, Xiaoshun Xu, Abdul Ghiasy, Sunghak Hong, Hannah Erdevig 

Description:

Vision Statement:

Motivation: Some buildings are hard to find the way without using stairs. This might be a trouble to wheelchair users since they are unable to use stairs. This inconvenience to handicapped people motivated us to create a direction indicator for wheelchair users.

Risk: First of all, all 5 members of us are kind of newbie in programming.
we've done only few programming languages which have learnt in CSCI 1 & 2, and little skills of Linux. 
unstable meeting time can be also problem, since each people has individual schedule.
Even if we've met in 3pm Monday, there is no garantee that we can meet again at the same time on next week.

Risk Mitigation Plan: practice, look for help specifically CSEL, try trials to get best answers.
unstable meeting time can be overcome by planning multiple meeting schedule per Milestone week. Also, since we are decided to use slack for communication, even someone didn't present to the meeting, we still can communicate with that person via online stuff.

Version Control: The version control method and repository we are using for deliverables created for our project is Github.

Development Method: We are going to be using a an Agile/Scrum methodology and folowing the main steps that include Plan, Design, Build, Test, and Review. We will be keeping organized and on top of our objectives through our Scrum meetings, or Stand-Ups. 

Collaboration Tool: Slack will be our main form of communication among team members and to utilize for coordination.
