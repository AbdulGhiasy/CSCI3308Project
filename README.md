# CSCI3308Project

Team Name: Team 7

Members: Phi Trang, Xiaoshun Xu, Abdul Ghiasy, Sunghak Hong, Hannah Erdevig 

Description:

Vision Statement: 

Motivation: Some buildings are hard to find the way without using stairs. This might be a trouble to wheelchair users since they are unable to use stairs. This inconvenience to handicapped people motivated us to create a direction indicator for wheelchair users.

Risks: It is evident that all members of the group lack experience in our area of focus to some extent. Most of our programming experience that can be applied to the course comes from CSCI foundation courses we have already taken such as CSCI 1300 & CSCI 2270. In addition to our lack of experience, another risk we have established is schedule conflicts. Each of our schedules is different from one another, so setting a constant time to meet in person varies weekly, meaning there is no guarantee that we could meet at the same time each week consistently.

Risk Mitigation Plan: In order to account for our lack of experience, our best plan to improve our knowledge in our area of focus is research, look for help (specifically CSEL), and through trial and error. As for scheduling conflicts, it can be overcome by planning multiple meetings per Milestone week. Plus, our main collaboration tool, Slack, will always be a fallback or back-up if we are unable to meet in person.

Version Control: The version control method and repository we are using for deliverables created for our project is Github.

Development Method: We are going to be using a an Agile/Scrum methodology and folowing the main steps that include Plan, Design, Build, Test, and Review. We will be keeping organized and on top of our objectives through our Scrum meetings, or Stand-Ups. 

Collaboration Tool: Slack will be our main form of communication among team members and to utilize for coordination.
