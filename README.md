# CSCI3308Project

Team Name: Team 7

Members: Phi Trang, Xiaoshun Xu, Abdul Ghiasy, Sunghak Hong, Hannah Erdevig 

Description: On our CU campus, there are many obstacles that wheelchair users are likely to run into if they are not aware of them beforehand. These obstacles include stairs, curbs, doors without door openers, bicycle routes, and steep hills. With our product, a user will be shown the best handicap accessible route between a point on a map of the CU Boulder campus that they select and a chosen destination building. This route will be illustrated for the user on a visual map of the campus. The route shown on the map will display a path that intentionally avoids outdoor staircases and bikeways along the way to the destination. At the destination, the positions of handicap accessible doors, elevators, and bathrooms within the building will be marked on the map. Users will also be able to set preferences, such as ignoring steep hills as an obstacle or only considering entrances/exits with automatic doors or door openers. Our product will be created in the form of a mobile phone app or website, so that it can easily be used while on the go. We may also include the users position as well as bus stops and handicap parking as features marked on the map.

Vision Statement: People restricted to wheelchair accessible travel will be able to use our mobile app to direct them along the best, safe route to their chosen destination on campus.

Motivation: Finding handicap accessible routes around campus can pose a great challange to those restricted to such travel. At this time, we have not been able to find an existing program or app that acts as a significant aid in overcoming this challenge. Creating a route planner for wheelchair users would allow them to more easily find their way to various locations around campus and promote. Providing such a resource will promote meaningful and universal accessibility for all members of the community

Risks: It is evident that all members of the group lack experience in developing usable software. Most of our programming experience that can be applied to this project comes from the CSCI 1300 & CSCI 2270 foundation courses. In addition to our lack of experience, another risk we have established is the possibility of falling behind scheduale becausse of scheduling conflicts. Each of our schedules is different from one another, so setting a regular weekly meeting time would not be possible to uphold every week. This means that there is no guarantee that we could meet at the same time each week consistently.

Risk Mitigation Plan: In order to account for our lack of experience, we will improve our understanding of the methods involved in our project by conducting research, looking for help (specifically in CSEL), and planning time for many revisions and problem solving through trial and error. Scheduling conflicts will be overcome by planning multiple regular meetings per Milestone week to increase the chances that everyone will be able to meet. Our main collaboration tool, Slack, will serve a fallback or back-up discussion medium in the event that we are unable to meet to discuss our project in person.

Version Control: The version control method and repository we are using for deliverables created for our project is Github.

Development Method: We are going to be using a an Agile/Scrum methodology. This will entail planning sprints based on different product features and discussing relative difficulty of creating such features. This will be followed by design, build, test, and review phases. We will stay organized and on top of our objectives through weekly or as-needed "Scrum meetings", or "Stand-Ups" where we discuss progress updates and new challenges via Slack. 

Collaboration Tool: Slack will be our main form of communication among team members and will be utilized to coordinationate meetings.
